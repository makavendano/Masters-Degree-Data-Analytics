## Predictive Modeling 
The point of this project is to build on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis, enabling us to make assertions vital to organizational needs. In this project, I conduct logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena revealed by data. This project covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance, preparing us to communicate findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders.

## Competencies 
**Logistic Regression**<br>
Employs logistic regression algorithms in describing phenomena.<br>

<br>**Multiple Regression**<br>
Employs multiple regression algorithms with categorical and numerical predictors in describing phenomena.

<br>**Regression Implications**<br>
Makes assertions based on regression modeling.<br>

## Tools Used: 
- Python
- Excel
