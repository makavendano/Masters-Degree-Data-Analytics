## Data Mining II
Data Mining II adds vital tools to the data analytics arsenal that incorporates unsupervised models. This project explains when, how, and why to use these tools to best meet organizational needs. As organizations generate exponentially more data each year, it is vitally important that they can use this data in ways that help drive toward their goals. Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and correlations within large sets of data. Organizations can then use these patterns or correlations to accurately predict outcomes, identify significant variables, or to perform lift analysis. Information technology professionals with skills in data mining are increasingly in demand to help organizations maximize the value of the organization’s data. In this course you will use Python or R to apply clustering techniques, implement dimensional reduction methods, and predict patterns in data using market basket analysis.
